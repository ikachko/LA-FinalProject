Formally, we denote  each observed recording as $\bx_i$ and each latent original signal as $\bs_j$. Then, linear mixing procedure might be written as 

\[ \bx_i = a_{i1} \bs_1 + \ldots + a_{in} \bs_n, i = \overline{1, m}, \]
or, in a matrix form, 
\[ X = A S, \]
where $A = \left[a_{ij} \right]$ is called a mixing matrix and is unknown. Usually, we assume that the number of recordings $m$ equals the number of original sources $n$.

Our problem is then to find an estimate of the "unmixing matrix" $W = A^{-1}$  and restore original sources $S = W X$.
